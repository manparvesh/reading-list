# Books I gave up on reading
## Fiction and stories
Serial no. | Book title | Progress | Reasons
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. | The oath of the Vayuputras | ![Reading progress](http://progressed.io/bar/30?title=240%20pages%20of%20575) | lost interest
2. | A game of thrones | ![Reading progress](http://progressed.io/bar/13?title=110%20pages%20of%20835) | Doesn't suit my interests. Maybe the complete fantasy genre is just not the thing for me :sweat_smile:
3. | To Kill a Mockingbird | ![Reading progress](http://progressed.io/bar/90?title=approximately) | Lost interest because of too much serious issues were being discussed. Couldn't take it.
